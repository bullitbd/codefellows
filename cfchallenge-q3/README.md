Q3 - went a bit overboard with this, so lots of half finished routines.  Classes are there and you can run main.js which builds up a sample library of shelves and books organized by genre - hopefully that will show what you are after.  Although there are shelf add/remove book routines, I took the approach that Libraries have books, which they put on or remove from shelves - so those methods belong to Libraries - which do call the shelf methods.


_Model a library using objects. *  
A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate._
